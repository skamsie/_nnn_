INTRODUCTION                                     *news-headlines-intro*

A vim plugin that shows the latest news headines. The content is based
on https://newsapi.org.

The main idea is not to read the articles themselves in Vim, but rather get a
quick overwiev of most recent headlines. The only information shown is title,
date of publishing, description and url. The url can be opened in the browser
using a key combination.


REQUIREMENTS                                     *news-headlines-requirements*

* Vim compiled with python or python3 support.
* An api key for newsapi.org (https://newsapi.org/register). It is free for non
  comercial use.
* `export VIM_NEWS_API_KEY=<your_api_key>`


USAGE                                            *news-headlines-usage*

The main command `:News` is used to load the content in a new buffer.

Without any arguments:
It uses the configuration to look for articles. See CONFIGURATION below.

With arguments:
You can pass sources and topics as arguments, and the results will be returned
based on them instead of the variables configured in your .vimrc. You can pass
both sources and topics separated by commas.

Sources are the source ids from newsapi.org. Use `S` to show all sources or
check the api documentation.

Topics have to start with a `/` and consist of a string of one word or more words
separated by whitespace. The language of the results as well as the desired
sorting algorithm can be specified by using `:` and the language abbreviation,
followed by `:` and the sorting type. They are however optional and if not
specified the defaults will be used (see CONFIGURATION for defaults)

EXAMPLES:~
Search for articles from cnn only:
`:News cnn`

Search for multiple topics:
`:News /vim, /bitcoin:en:popularity, /climate change::relevancy`

Search sources and topics:
`:News bbc-news, /bitcoin:en:popularity`

NOTES:~
The sources accept no parameters as they are simply publication names.
<400 Bad Request> from newsapi probably means an error with the format of your
parameters or config.

BUFFER COMMANDS:~
* `O` Open the article in browser (while cursor is on title or description)
* `F` Folds or unflods the articles under the current source
* `S` Show all possible news sources
* `<CR>` While on the top index bar, goes to the corresponding section


CONFIGURATION                                    *news-headlines-configuration*

Global variables that can be configured in .vimrc or locally.

`g:news_headlines_sources`
    - set the desired sources for the articles (max 20 sources)
    - the values must be separated by comma

`g:news_headlines_topics`
    - set the desired topics
    - variable is not set by default
    - it is used to search articles by topic instead of source

      `    \   {'topic': 'angela merkel', 'language': 'de'},`
      `    \   {'topic': 'apple', 'sort_by': 'popularity'}`
      `    \ ]`
    documentation: https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

`g:news_headlines_wrap_text`
    - where to wrap text (integer)

COLORS                                           *news-headlines-colors*

The plugin tries to match the syntax to your current colorscheme. However,
if needed, the highlights can be overwritten. Just drop something like the
following in your .vimrc:

`function! SetNHColors()`
  `hi NHSource ctermfg=1 ctermbg=8 guifg=#E12672 guibg=#565656`
  `hi link NHLink Statement`
`endfunction`

`au! BufEnter,ColorScheme *.news-headlines call SetNHColors()`
